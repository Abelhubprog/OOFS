# OOF Frontend - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing React Dependencies**: The package.json file was missing React and ReactDOM dependencies, which are required by the application.
2. **Port Conflict**: Port 3000 was already in use by another process (node.exe with PID 9344).
3. **Dependency Installation Issues**: There were problems with pnpm installing dependencies due to cache/permission issues.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Added Missing Dependencies**: Updated package.json to include:
   - react (^18.2.0)
   - react-dom (^18.2.0)
   - @types/react (^18.2.0)
   - @types/react-dom (^18.2.0)
   - @tanstack/react-query (^5.0.0)
   - wouter (^3.0.0)

2. **Changed Development Port**: Updated vite.config.ts to use port 3001 instead of 3000 to avoid conflicts.

## Remaining Steps

1. **Clean Installation**: 
   - Delete node_modules directory
   - Delete pnpm-lock.yaml and package-lock.json files
   - Run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies cleanly

2. **Start Development Server**:
   - Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server
   - Access the application at http://localhost:3001

## Manual Commands (if terminal tools don't work)

1. Navigate to the Frontend directory:
   ```
   cd D:\OOFs\Frontend
   ```

2. Clean previous installations:
   ```
   rmdir /s /q node_modules
   del pnpm-lock.yaml
   del package-lock.json
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Start development server:
   ```
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Alternative Method

If pnpm continues to have issues, you can use the provided dev-win.bat file:
```
dev-win.bat
```

This will start the development server on port 3001 as configured.

  - Centralizes configuration, database pool management, telemetry, authentication, and shared types.
  - Example: `config.rs` loads environment variables, `db.rs` manages PostgreSQL connections, `auth.rs` handles JWT and wallet authentication.

- **crates/api**
  - Implements the Axum API server, exposing REST and SSE endpoints.
  - Handles routing, request validation, response formatting, and metrics collection.
  - Example: `routes.rs` defines `/v1/analyze`, `/v1/moments`, `/v1/cards/moment/<id>.png` endpoints.

- **crates/indexer**
  - Listens for Helius webhooks, deduplicates incoming transactions, and ingests actions/participants into the database.
  - Example: `main.rs` sets up webhook listener, parses Solana transactions, and triggers moment detection.

- **crates/workers**
  - Runs background jobs for backfilling wallet data, computing moments, and refreshing price snapshots.
  - Example: `jobs/backfill_wallet.rs` processes historical wallet data, `jobs/price_snapshots.rs` updates price info.

- **crates/detectors**
  - Contains the position engine and moment detectors (S2E, BHD, BadRoute, Idle).
  - Example: `position.rs` models wallet positions, `prices.rs` fetches price data, `trait_detector.rs` implements detection logic.

- **crates/renderer**
  - Renders SVG cards for moments and converts them to PNG for sharing.
  - Example: `templates/moment_card.svg` is the base template, `lib.rs` handles rendering pipeline.

- **crates/anchor_sdk**
  - Provides builders for Solana program instructions, extensible for future integrations.

#### 4.2. Data Structures

- **Wallet Analysis Request**
```rust
struct AnalyzeRequest {
    wallets: Vec<String>, // List of wallet public keys
}
```

- **OOF Moment**
```rust
struct OOFMoment {
    id: Uuid,
    wallet: String,
    moment_type: String, // S2E, BHD, etc.
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    details: MomentDetails,
}
```

- **MomentDetails**
```rust
struct MomentDetails {
    asset: String,
    price: Decimal,
    regret_score: f32,
    description: String,
}
```

#### 4.3. Flowchart: Wallet Analysis Pipeline

### Advanced Backend Module Walkthroughs

#### Example: Moment Detection Algorithm (Rust)
```rust
// crates/detectors/src/trait_detector.rs
pub fn detect_moment(tx: &Transaction, price_history: &PriceHistory) -> Option<OOFMoment> {
    let regret_score = calculate_regret(tx, price_history);
    if regret_score > THRESHOLD {
        Some(OOFMoment {
            id: Uuid::new_v4(),
            wallet: tx.wallet.clone(),
            moment_type: classify_moment(tx),
            timestamp: tx.timestamp,
            details: MomentDetails {
                asset: tx.asset.clone(),
                price: tx.price,
                regret_score,
                description: format!("{} missed {}% gain", tx.wallet, regret_score),
            },
        })
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

#### Example: Card Rendering Pipeline (Rust)
```rust
// crates/renderer/src/lib.rs
pub fn render_card(moment: &OOFMoment) -> Result<Vec<u8>, RenderError> {
    let svg = render_svg(moment);
    let png = svg_to_png(&svg)?;
    Ok(png)
}
```

// crates/detectors/src/trait_detector.rs
pub fn detect_moment(tx: &Transaction, price_history: &PriceHistory) -> Option<OOFMoment> {
    let regret_score = calculate_regret(tx, price_history);
    if regret_score > THRESHOLD {
        Some(OOFMoment {
            id: Uuid::new_v4(),
            wallet: tx.wallet.clone(),
            moment_type: classify_moment(tx),
            timestamp: tx.timestamp,
            details: MomentDetails {
                asset: tx.asset.clone(),
                price: tx.price,
                regret_score,
                description: format!("{} missed {}% gain", tx.wallet, regret_score),
            },
        })
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

#### Example: Card Rendering Pipeline (Rust)

### Backend Code Walkthrough

#### 4.1. Core Crates and Their Roles

- **crates/shared**
  - Centralizes configuration, database pool management, telemetry, authentication, and shared types.
  - Example: `config.rs` loads environment variables, `db.rs` manages PostgreSQL connections, `auth.rs` handles JWT and wallet authentication.

- **crates/api**
  - Implements the Axum API server, exposing REST and SSE endpoints.
  - Handles routing, request validation, response formatting, and metrics collection.
  - Example: `routes.rs` defines `/v1/analyze`, `/v1/moments`, `/v1/cards/moment/<id>.png` endpoints.

- **crates/indexer**
  - Listens for Helius webhooks, deduplicates incoming transactions, and ingests actions/participants into the database.
  - Example: `main.rs` sets up webhook listener, parses Solana transactions, and triggers moment detection.

- **crates/workers**
  - Runs background jobs for backfilling wallet data, computing moments, and refreshing price snapshots.
  - Example: `jobs/backfill_wallet.rs` processes historical wallet data, `jobs/price_snapshots.rs` updates price info.

- **crates/detectors**
  - Contains the position engine and moment detectors (S2E, BHD, BadRoute, Idle).
  - Example: `position.rs` models wallet positions, `prices.rs` fetches price data, `trait_detector.rs` implements detection logic.

- **crates/renderer**
  - Renders SVG cards for moments and converts them to PNG for sharing.
  - Example: `templates/moment_card.svg` is the base template, `lib.rs` handles rendering pipeline.

- **crates/anchor_sdk**
  - Provides builders for Solana program instructions, extensible for future integrations.

#### 4.2. Data Structures

- **Wallet Analysis Request**
```rust
struct AnalyzeRequest {
    wallets: Vec<String>, // List of wallet public keys
}
```

- **OOF Moment**
```rust
struct OOFMoment {
    id: Uuid,
    wallet: String,
    moment_type: String, // S2E, BHD, etc.
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    details: MomentDetails,
}
```

- **MomentDetails**
```rust
struct MomentDetails {
    asset: String,
    price: Decimal,
    regret_score: f32,
    description: String,
}
```

#### 4.4. Algorithms

- **OOF Moment Detection**
  - For each transaction, compare buy/sell timing against price history.
  - Calculate regret score based on missed gains/losses.
  - Classify moment type (S2E, BHD, etc.) using rule-based and AI-enhanced logic.

- **Card Rendering**
  - Use SVG templates with dynamic data injection.
  - Convert SVG to PNG for sharing via API.

#### 4.5. Error Handling & Security

- JWT authentication for sensitive endpoints.
- Rate limiting per IP and per wallet.

### Advanced Backend Module Walkthroughs

#### Example: Moment Detection Algorithm (Rust)
```rust
// crates/detectors/src/trait_detector.rs
pub fn detect_moment(tx: &Transaction, price_history: &PriceHistory) -> Option<OOFMoment> {
    let regret_score = calculate_regret(tx, price_history);
    if regret_score > THRESHOLD {
        Some(OOFMoment {
            id: Uuid::new_v4(),
            wallet: tx.wallet.clone(),
            moment_type: classify_moment(tx),
            timestamp: tx.timestamp,
            details: MomentDetails {
                asset: tx.asset.clone(),
                price: tx.price,
                regret_score,
                description: format!("{} missed {}% gain", tx.wallet, regret_score),
            },
        })
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

#### Example: Card Rendering Pipeline (Rust)
```rust
// crates/renderer/src/lib.rs
pub fn render_card(moment: &OOFMoment) -> Result<Vec<u8>, RenderError> {
    let svg = render_svg(moment);
    let png = svg_to_png(&svg)?;
    Ok(png)
}
```

### Backend Code Walkthrough

#### 4.1. Core Crates and Their Roles

- **crates/shared**
  - Centralizes configuration, database pool management, telemetry, authentication, and shared types.
  - Example: `config.rs` loads environment variables, `db.rs` manages PostgreSQL connections, `auth.rs` handles JWT and wallet authentication.

- **crates/api**
  - Implements the Axum API server, exposing REST and SSE endpoints.
  - Handles routing, request validation, response formatting, and metrics collection.
  - Example: `routes.rs` defines `/v1/analyze`, `/v1/moments`, `/v1/cards/moment/<id>.png` endpoints.

- **crates/indexer**
  - Listens for Helius webhooks, deduplicates incoming transactions, and ingests actions/participants into the database.
  - Example: `main.rs` sets up webhook listener, parses Solana transactions, and triggers moment detection.

- **crates/workers**
  - Runs background jobs for backfilling wallet data, computing moments, and refreshing price snapshots.
  - Example: `jobs/backfill_wallet.rs` processes historical wallet data, `jobs/price_snapshots.rs` updates price info.

- **crates/detectors**
  - Contains the position engine and moment detectors (S2E, BHD, BadRoute, Idle).
  - Example: `position.rs` models wallet positions, `prices.rs` fetches price data, `trait_detector.rs` implements detection logic.

- **crates/renderer**
  - Renders SVG cards for moments and converts them to PNG for sharing.
  - Example: `templates/moment_card.svg` is the base template, `lib.rs` handles rendering pipeline.

- **crates/anchor_sdk**
  - Provides builders for Solana program instructions, extensible for future integrations.

#### 4.2. Data Structures

- **Wallet Analysis Request**
```rust
struct AnalyzeRequest {
    wallets: Vec<String>, // List of wallet public keys
}
```

- **OOF Moment**
```rust
struct OOFMoment {
    id: Uuid,
    wallet: String,
    moment_type: String, // S2E, BHD, etc.
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    details: MomentDetails,
}
```

- **MomentDetails**
```rust
struct MomentDetails {
    asset: String,
    price: Decimal,
    regret_score: f32,
    description: String,
}
```
